# Turn-base-fight V0
Turn-base fight simulation. Was planned like a fully separate module, what can be used in games.
Not completed:
1. Inventory (placeholder)
1. Using unit all characteristics
1. Many types of spells
1. Graphic
1. Dying
1. Separateness

But it works.

Controls:
1. Esc        - exit
1. Backspace  - cancel
1. Enter      - confirm
1. Arrow up   - move up
1. Arrow down - move down
